1. Preface

Hello and thanks for actually taking the effort to actually read this little manual for the TIAS alpha release (which means: things aren't optimal yet).

First of all, I'd like to inform you that TIAS will only work in combination with the Japan Set's Trains and Tracks NewGRFs in action. These must also be loaded before TIAS in order to make TIAS work. TIAS will not function as a standalone or in combination with NewGRF sets other than Japan Set Trains and Tracks. Combinations of Japan Set Trains and Tracks with other NewGRFs is possible.
As a bonus, TIAS will adjust its values of purchase costs and running costs accordingly to the Japan Set Trains parameters you've assigned! This is done in order to make TIAS a great alternative next to the standard Japanese trains.

 *only in combination with Japan Set 3 releases.*
Please also note that TIAS is entirely a standard gauge set and will thus also allow (Mini-)Shinkansen to run together with the trains in this set. In real life, trains that appear in TIAS don't run on the same tracks as Shinkansen trains. Nobody is obliging you (the user of TIAS) anything, but for realism's sake, please don't mix TIAS trains and Shinkansen together. For gameplay reasons, mixing Shinkansen and TIAS trains isn't very useful as well, since TIAS trains generally don't exceed 120 km/h (with only a few exceptions) and Shinkansen generally do have much higher cruise speeds, it's not economically feasible to run them together.*



2. About the companies in TIAS

As described in the title, TIAS means "Toei Inter-connecting Add-on Set". "Toei" stands for "Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transport", which is the organisation that runs the Asakusa Subway Line. This line in turn provides a connection to the Keisei network on one end and the Keikyu network on the other (well, not exactly, but still). This connection thus ensures through operations between the Keisei, Keikyu and Toei networks, and provides a direct connection between the two major airports of Tokyo: Narita on the Keisei network and Haneda on the Keikyu network.

About the Keisei Group first. The first trains become available around 1911 and have their last new release in 2010, so there is a lot of game time in which you can choose between numerous Keisei Group operated trains. The Keisei Group consists of Keisei Railroad (KSlogo), Shin-Keisei Railroad (SKSlogo), Hokuso (Development) Railroad (HKTlogo), and Chiba New Town Railway (CNTlogo). Other companies that are included in the Keisei network, are the Shibayama Railway, plus the former Chiba Express Railway (CElogo) (taken over by Keisei in 1998).
The Keisei network consists of: 
- Main Line (Ueno - Aoto - Takasago - Tsudanuma - Narita - Narita Airport);
- Oshiage Line ((Toei Asakusa Line -) Oshiage - Aoto);
- Narita Airport Line (Takasago -* Narita Airport) (direct fast line);
- Chiba/Chihara Line (Tsudanuma - Chiharadai);
- Kanamachi Line (Takasago - Kanamachi);
- Higashi-Narita Line (Narita - Higashi-Narita -* Shibayama-Chiyoda)
- Shin-Keisei Line* (Matsudo - Tsudanuma).
* tracks (partially) owned by Keisei Group, but not by Keisei itself
The trains that run on this network have a maximum length of 8 cars.

Secondly, there is Keikyu (KQlogo). The first trains become available around 1904 and have their last new release in 2002, so here as well, there is a lot of game time in which to choose your rolling stock. The Keikyu Railway is independent and has no subsidaries or any other related secondary/tertiary companies.
The Keikyu network consists of:
- Main Line (Sengakuji - Horinouchi - Kanazawa-Hakkei - Kawasaki - Kamata - Shinagawa (- Sengakuji @ Toei Asakusa Line));
- Kurihama Line (Horinouchi - Misakiguchi);
- Zushi Line (Kanazawa-Hakkei - Shin-Zushi);
- Daishi Line (Kawasaki - Kojimashinden);
- Airport Line (Kamata - Haneda Airport).
Trains from Keikyu in 'Group 2' that run on their own network have a maximum length of 12 cars, but trains from other companies, and Keikyu 'Group 1' trains, still remain their 8 car maximum length.

Thirdly and lastly we have Toei. This company operates the reason for the existence of TIAS, the Asakusa Line (or Line #1). This line was opened in 1968 and brought Keisei and Keikyu together. Thus, in 1968 certain Keikyu trains become available on the Keisei network, and vice versa. Toei also owns several types of trains, so these also are available on both Keisei and Keikyu networks.
The Toei Asakusa Line consists of:
- Main Line (Nishi-Magome - Sengakuji - Oshiage (- Keisei Oshiage Line));
At Sengakuji the line branches off to the Keikyu Main Line in direction to Shinagawa.
The trains that run on this network have a maximum length of 8 cars.


3. About the parameters

There are in fact two parameters, but only 2 are manual. The invisible parameters deal with balancing TIAS against the Japan Set Trains (running costs, capacities and loading speed).

The first parameter is the choice of company focus. Here you can choose weather you'd like to focus on Keisei, Keikyu, both or literally all trains (which I don't recommend).
- Setting 1 (Keisei focussed): All trains operated on the Keisei networks. This includes all Keisei, Shin-Keisei, Hokuso, Chiba New Town, Chiba Express, Shibayama and some Keikyu trains. The maximum length of trains here is 8 cars (4 tiles), but is compensated by: a greater and more colourful variation of trains, of which the awesome and destinctive Skyliners from Keisei;
- Setting 2 (Keikyu focussed): All trains operated on the Keikyu network. This includes all Keikyu trains, Toei Asakusa Line clearance free Keisei, Hokuso, Chiba New Town and Shibayama trains. The number of trains isn't as great as in the Keisei focussed setting, but is compensated with longer Keikyu trains (max. 12 cars in 'Group 2'), a general higher speed and high inter-compatibility of Keikyu train consists in two different groups;
- Setting 3 (All Trains): Includes all trains from the set, excluding double Keikyu ID slots. This is ideal for online/LAN network games, as each player can decide on what company to focus. Recommended is the use of Shared Infrastructure if possible. However, do please note that Shin-Keisei and Keikyu trains never share the same tracks in real life! This apart from the Narita-facing entrance of Keisei Kamata's station tracks and a few maintenance runs. (default).

The second parameter chooses the sounds.
- Setting 1: all sounds off;
- Setting 2: starting sounds only (default);
- Setting 3: starting, running and loading sounds;


4. How to use the set

The way TIAS is played with is not much like any other set. All trains in this set are fixed articulated consists and can only have specific vehicles attached (or none at all). These specific things are explained in detail in each individual description.

There are however some things to remember before playing with TIAS.


4.1 Tips on how to behave yourself with TIAS

The following text is merely a guideline which necessarily needn't be followed, but can enhance the TIAS experience to great extends!

- Working with TIAS in the first place doesn't require you to build stations longer than 1 to 6 tiles (single to 12 car consists) depending on your setting. This means you can concentrate on compact station layouts.
- Please note that TIAS trains run largely on urban networks, with close-by stations, so please don't hesitate to work in such an environment as well;
- TIAS isn't designed to work as a means of long-distance transport. Maximum speeds don't exceed 110~130km/h, with the exception of the Keisei AE2 Skyliner at 160km/h, so don't invest in expensive tracks until the AE2 appears. It'll only be a waste of your money;
- Talking about money: TIAS also requires you to save up to invest in rolling stock in one go. Trains are long and thus require you to have a large spare amount to invest in a new train. You can't plan on buying each car individually, so plan ahead;
- Some trains only appear for a short amount of time, so if you need a number of them, don't hesitate to invest in a few more than you initially may need. Trains that are bought can always be sold back if they never ran;
- Always read each train's description before buying them (do I even need to mention this?).


4.2 How TIAS behaves through time

From the beginning on (early 20th century) some trains cannot be combined with any other train and are required to run as a single car train. This may seem ridiculous at the start, but these trains have a fairly high capacity and should prove no problem coping with early passenger numbers.

Going further into the 1920s/30s, combining trains is getting more and more encouraged. Until the  1940s trains are generally bought as single cars and should thus be combined together to form longer trains. Combining different types from the same operating company shouldn't be a problem and was practised much the same way in real life. In each vehicle's description is stated to what extend it can be lenthened.

However, in the 1950s, cities will begin to grow drastically and you'll need to invest in newer and longer rolling stock (which will become available in ever growing numbers during that time). In the early 1950s trains will mostly be released a two car consists, but later in that decade four car trains will become available.

Entering the 1970s, the first six car trains become available. With the first full eight car train in the late 1970s. However, it's not until the mid-1980s where this slowly becomes a standard. Until that time, you'll have to invest in expanding shorter consists if needed.

As time progresses towards the 21st century combining consists is getting less important. Keikyu trains on their own tracks however, (in 'Keikyu focussed' and 'All Trains' setting) can reach a max. length of 12 cars. This means that even eight car Keikyu trains can be further lengthened with a four car Keikyu consist.

In time, express trains become available in between the acts. These trains are expensive, have a lower capacity, but are generally faster. Use these to connect your major stations in order for them to be economically feasible. These trains in real life much play the same role as in TIAS and don't make up any major part of the fleet, nor do they generate massive profits. Keikyu has for example the 500 Type 2-door, 2000 Type 2-door and 2100 Type. Keisei has the Kaiun 1500/1600 Types and Skyliner AE series. Other companies in TIAS don't have any special express dedicated rolling stock, but do occasionally have commuter trains with higher max. speeds.


4.3 How to use each company realistically

- Keisei & Keikyu: operate each a large network with many stations and have a large variety of services ranging from locals to dedicated express trains. Focus on either of these companies to make an efficient and large network in your game. Both companies also have relative high-speed services. Keisei having the Skyliners on their Ueno - Narita Airport runs (battling the JR N'EX trains) and Keikyu having their famous trains on the Yokohama - Kamata - Shinagawa runs (battling JR on parallel running tracks).
- Shin-Keisei & Chiba Express: with Shin-Keisei still in operation and Chiba Express being overtaken by Keisei in 1998, these networks are/were partially separated from the Keisei network. Speeds don't go above 95km/h, but the trains are cheaper to run than other trains. Use these in dense urban areas with short distances. These companies also never operated beyond Takasago, so shouldn't have any presence on Toei and/or Keikyu tracks. Note: Chiba Express trains have a max. length of 4 cars!
- Hokuso & Chiba New Town: these trains have a partial own network, but are fully integrated in the Keisei network. Use these companies to develop new lines that eventually will be part of a bigger network with through trains. In a Shared Infrastructure game, these companies should generate most of its profit from other companies' trains running on its tracks, or should be subsidiaries from a Keisei focussed player.
- Toei: use this company as a intermediate between your Keisei and Keikyu networks (in 'All Trains' setting). In a Shared Infrastructure game, this company should generate most of its profit from other companies' trains running on its tracks.
- Shibayama: a relative strange company. Brought to life in 1981, but only started operations in 2002. Shibayama only owns a short piece of track between Higashi-Narita and Shibayama-Chiyoda station. This company also has only one train under its command: a leased 3600 Type from Keisei. However, due to complicated reasons, this train can hardly be seen running on its home tracks. This company also doesn't operate on Keikyu tracks.


5. Final words

I hope this README was sufficient enough for you to understand the concept of the TIAS and how to use it properly. Well, you're not obliged to do so, but still...

Anyway, start up a game and enjoy TIAS!

Cheers!
